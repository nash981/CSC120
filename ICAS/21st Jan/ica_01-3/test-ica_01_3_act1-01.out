Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a
Line length: 80
new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men
Line length: 19
are created equal.

Line length: 77
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any
Line length: 77
nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great
Line length: 80
battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a
Line length: 79
final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might
Line length: 66
live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

Line length: 79
But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate, we can not
Line length: 77
hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have
Line length: 75
consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will
Line length: 78
little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what
Line length: 76
they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the
Line length: 79
unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It
Line length: 73
is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before
Line length: 77
us-that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for
Line length: 78
which they gave the last full measure of devotion-that we here highly resolve
Line length: 79
that these dead shall not have died in vain-that this nation, under God, shall
Line length: 78
have a new birth of freedom-and that government of the people, by the people,
Line length: 49
for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
