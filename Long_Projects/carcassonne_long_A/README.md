# carcassonne_tools
Graphical display tools, to help students debug their class implementations in the Carcassonne family of projects

# NOTE NOTE NOTE
These tools will *not* help you play the physical Carcassonne game.

These tools are *not* part of any attempt to recreate the Carcassonne game.

They are just debugging tools, related to a school project.  The students write the code, and I (the instructor) provided a set of visual tools to see if their code was correct.  I'm posting it here so that students can (if they wish) submit changes to make the debugger more effective or flexible.
