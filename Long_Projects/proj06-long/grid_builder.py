    Description:
    This is aimed to practice linked lists and classes.

    By default (unless you tell a function to return something else),
    all functions return None. None is actually a special type of object.
    This is important because if None is a value, "returns nothing,"
    "doesn't return anything," and "no returns" are incorrect.

class Grid:
    """
        This class represents one room in a grid.  It can contain any number
        of rooms in north, south, east and west direction .

        The constructor builds an empty room; you must pass it
        references to the four adjacent rooms (each might be None) - â‰ˆ
        references to the reconfigured later.

        The class defines several helpful methods and fields:
            setter():     - setter function for the 4 different
            directions.
            set_name():   - setter function for name field
            get_name():   - getter function for name field
            collapse_room() - This function sets all the links of a
            particular room to None. It also sets the links of the
            adjacent rooms point towards itself to None
