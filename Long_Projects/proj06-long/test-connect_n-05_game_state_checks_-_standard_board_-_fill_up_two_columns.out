Building the new object...

Playing a few moves... (nothing should be rejected, in this set)

Playing many more moves... (I expect to definitely have some columns fill up eventually)
A move was rejected.  i=13 MOVES[i]=3
A move was rejected.  i=15 MOVES[i]=2
A move was rejected.  i=19 MOVES[i]=3
A move was rejected.  i=21 MOVES[i]=3
A move was rejected.  i=22 MOVES[i]=2
A move was rejected.  i=23 MOVES[i]=2
A move was rejected.  i=24 MOVES[i]=3
A move was rejected.  i=25 MOVES[i]=2
A move was rejected.  i=26 MOVES[i]=3
A move was rejected.  i=27 MOVES[i]=3
A move was rejected.  i=28 MOVES[i]=3
