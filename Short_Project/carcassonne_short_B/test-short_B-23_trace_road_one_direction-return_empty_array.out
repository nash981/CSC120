The next testcase will start with this map, and try to extend it in many ways.

Creating the initial map...
Adding the many tiles...

Calling trace_road_one_direction() on a few locations...

  t_r_o_d( 3, 2,N) returned: []
  t_r_o_d( 1, 0,E) returned: []
  t_r_o_d(-1, 0,N) returned: []
  t_r_o_d(-1, 0,S) returned: []
  t_r_o_d(-2, 0,N) returned: []
  t_r_o_d(-2,-2,W) returned: []
